        <div class="contentBox">

                <div class="contentTitle">Here is WHY this page came into

                        I have been dreaming to have a nice little home page for
                        years now. But every time I got started on developing
                        one, I was only left wanting more from the page. I only
                        ended up trying to learn more and more web technologies
                        and never actually developing the website!
                    </p><br />
                    <p>
                        So one fine day when I was tyring (to find an excuse) to
                        do my work and write my thesis, I said to myself "Hmm..
                        I should build my home page now!". And so here we are!!
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="contentTitle">Here is HOW this page came into
                    existence.</div>
                <div class="contentText">
                    <p>
                        I figured I wasn't artistic enough to put together a
                        nice page from scratch and neither am I patient enough
                        to do that. So I borrowed from a bunch of template pages
                        from different places and worked my way from there. So
                        here are the sources:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Template: <a href="http://www.quackit.com/html/templates/">
                                An Ocean of Sky by Bryant Smith</a>
                            </li>
                            <li>CV page: <a href="http://sampleresumetemplate.net/">
                                http://sampleresumetemplate.net/</a>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p><br />
                    <p>
                        And ofcourse the website that has taught me everything I
                        know about web technology is 
                        <a href="http://w3schools.com">w3schools.com</a>. One of
                        my friends, who is a web expert, once told me that
                        w3schools is not a good place to learn from. But hey as
                        long as I can get my work done, who cares about
                        technicalities!!  Anyway I had to leave this disclaimer
                        just in case.
