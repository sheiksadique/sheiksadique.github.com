Nothing can match the happiness and satisfaction derived from knowing that one's innovations and
ideas are being applied to advance the society and that they are appreciated by people around the
globe. A strong urge to learn and then explain real-life observations on the basis of such learning has
enthralled me since my school days.

One of the projects I worked on titled "Excited Damped Double Pendulum" drew my attention to
biological sciences, when I tried to correlate the double pendulum problem to
the human limbs studying its dynamics. Human body structure was studied in great detail by
Leonardo da Vinci; his work "The Vitruvian man" was one of my inspirations to take this path. Leonardo
da Vinci is said to be an observational physicist and borrowed many ideas from nature. After the
completion of my project I tried experimenting with the variables so as to fit the model with the limbs of
Da-Vinci's "perfect man". To my astonishment the problem's complexity was reduced to a great extent
and an interesting phenomenon was observed. The motion no longer had multiple modes. This made
me wonder about the perfectness in the world, about the innumerous ideas and immense knowledge
available in nature.

Human subtlety will never devise an invention more beautiful, more simple or more direct than does
Nature, because in her inventions, nothing is lacking and nothing is superfluous. Simplicity is the
ultimate sophistication.
