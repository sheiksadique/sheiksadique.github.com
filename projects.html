        I am working on some exciting projects that are mostly driven by personal curiosity and with the goal of learning something new. Here are some of these projects from past and present.

                I have become very intrigued by Haskell, a purely functional programming language, and decided to learn how to Haskell. Functional programming, I discovered is very different from traditional C like programming languages, and has a steep learning curve if you are previously exposed to other non-functional programming languages. I feel like I need to "empty my mind" in order to learn Haskell, and this process has been a very exciting challenge so far. I wanted a project to work on to discover more Haskell by myself. I looked around and found no standard spike based neural network simulators in Haskell. And so HSimSNN was born.

                <a href="https://github.com/sheiksadique/HSimSNN">HSimSNN</a> is a Haskell based Simulator of Spiking Neural Networks. This project is brand new and not much thought has been given to witty naming so far. You can follow it on <a href="https://github.com/sheiksadique/HSimSNN">GitHub</a> to check on its progress, and even contribute if you like!

                <p>
                <a href="http://inincs.github.com/pyNCS/">pyNCS</a> is a python based software development project that aims to provide a set of software tools to configure and communicate with neuromorphic AER based devices. A short description of this work can be found <a href="http://ncs.ethz.ch/publications/abstracts/python-in-neuroscience-workshop">here</a>. This is perhaps one of the most well thought of and well worked projects I am actively involved in. I can attribute all my Python skills to this project. The project has multiple contributors and is actively being developed for more than six years as of 2015.
