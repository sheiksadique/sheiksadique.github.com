Nothing can match the happiness and satisfaction derived from knowing that one's innovations and
ideas are being applied to advance the society and that they are appreciated by people around the
globe. A strong urge to learn and then explain real-life observations on the basis of such learning has
enthralled me since my school days.                   
                </p><br/>

One of the projects I worked on titled &quot;Excited Damped Double Pendulum&quot; drew my attention to
biological sciences, when I tried to correlate the double pendulum problem to
the human limbs studying its dynamics. Human body structure was studied in great detail by
Leonardo da Vinci; his work &quot;The Vitruvian man&quot; was one of my inspirations to take this path. Leonardo
da Vinci is said to be an observational physicist and borrowed many ideas from nature. After the
completion of my project I tried experimenting with the variables so as to fit the model with the limbs of
Da-Vinci's &quot;perfect man&quot;. To my astonishment the problem's complexity was reduced to a great extent
and an interesting phenomenon was observed. The motion no longer had multiple modes. This made
me wonder about the perfectness in the world, about the innumerous ideas and immense knowledge
available in nature.
                </p><br/>
                <p>
Human subtlety will never devise an invention more beautiful, more simple or more direct than does
Nature, because in her inventions, nothing is lacking and nothing is superfluous. Simplicity is the
ultimate sophistication.
-Leonardo da Vinci

                        I have been dreaming to have a nice little home page for
                        years now. But every time I got started on developing
                        one, I was only left wanting more from the page. I only
                        ended up trying to learn more and more web technologies
                        and never actually developing the website!
                    </p><br/>
                    <p>
                        So one fine day when I was tyring (to find an excuse) to
                        do my work and write my thesis, I said to myself &quot;Hmm..
                        I should build my home page now!&quot;. And so here we are!!
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="contentTitle">Here is HOW this page came into
                    existence.</div>

                        I figured I wasn't artistic enough to put together a
                        nice page from scratch and neither am I patient enough
                        to do that. So I borrowed from a bunch of template pages
                        from different places and worked my way from there. So
                        here are the sources:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Template: <a href="http://www.quackit.com/html/templates/">
                                An Ocean of Sky by Bryant Smith</a>
                            </li>
                            <li>CV page: <a href="http://sampleresumetemplate.net/">
                                http://sampleresumetemplate.net/</a>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p><br/>
                    <p>
                        And ofcourse the website that has taught me everything I
                        know about web technology is 
                        <a href="http://w3schools.com">w3schools.com</a>. One of
                        my friends, who is a web expert, once told me that
                        w3schools is not a good place to learn from. But hey as
                        long as I can get my work done, who cares about
                        technicalities!!  Anyway I had to leave this disclaimer
                        just in case.
