            You know the feeling when you are struggling to figure out whats happening in your program, when you are putting all your googling skills to test, only to discover that there was some stupid bug/trick in the library that you did not know ? 
            You know the feeling when you are realize the crazy program that you spent a night developing could have been implemented in 4 simple lines ? 
            This is where all those spooky tricks will be shared for the greater good of mankind.

                    <p>Check out this page where the author nicely describes what the issues are in displaying programs in html pages and how you could overcome the problem : <a href="http://projectcerbera.com/web/articles/code-in-pre">Code Boxes with pre and CSS</a></p><br />
		            <p>Here is the gist of it. Use the 'pre' tag to embed your code and your job is done. If you want something more fancy you can modify its behavior with the css. Below is the css code they suggest on the above page.
                    <pre>
                        <code>
/* Code Samples */
pre {
 white-space: pre-wrap;
 white-space: -moz-pre-wrap;
 white-space: -o-pre-wrap;
 background: #faf8f0;
}
#content #pre-stylish code {
 display: block;
 padding: 0.5em 1em;
 border: 1px solid #bebab0;
}
                        </code>
                    </pre>

                <div class="contentText">
                    <p>Did you have to copy a hardisk or a large partition with dd and wished you knew how much longer its going to take for the process to finish ? Wished there was a progress bar ? Check this out <a href="http://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/view/5293/dd-with-progress-bar">dd with progress bar</a></p><br />
		            <p>It is actually uses the command pv to pipe data through, which then generates the progress bar. I suppose this could be done with other processes that involve large data transfer times like cp, althought I have never tried it myself. Here is what you need to do for dd with progress bar:
                    <pre>
                        <code>
dd if=/dev/nst0 |pv|dd of=restored_file.tar
                        </code>
                    </pre>
