                        Once I put on my sporting gear I am a whole different
                        person, and I absolutely love that dude ;).

                        Sports are a crucial part of my life and the most
                        effective means to get my adrenalin going. It serves as
                        portal into a different world altogether, a world where
                        nothing else exists but fun and excitement. It doesn't
                        matter to me what the game is as long as it is
                        competitive and fun (and less running, for i am very
                        lazy :P). Below is a list of activities I do or did in
                        the past.

                        Of all the games I can play this is my favorite. I have been playing badminton with friends since my school days, although I never had a formal training. The game is part of my instinct now and its traces can be seen in all the gaming I do, be it tennis or volleyball.

                <div class="contentTitle">Volley ball</div>
                <div class="contentText">
                    <p>For a &quot;not so tall&quot; person, volley ball isn't a very wise choice of sport. And yet when I started studying at college, that was the one game I thought I could play. Some of my friends played volleyball and I joined in. So I decided to join the NSO (the sports hour for a couple of credits at IIT KGP) and went for the trials. The coach asked me to do a couple of serves, and here is what happened: I couldn't get the ball across!! and ofcourse I had to buzz off.. Anyway long story short, I was part of the gold winning RK hall(hostel) team (3 years straight!) and IIT KGP team the last two years I was there. </p>
                    <p>To be honest, I used to feel like I was just following a few routines when I was playing volleyball; I never felt like I could just trust my instinct, like I could while playing badminton. But now I am slowly getting some feel for the game and am having a lot of fun!</p>
